# nedots

Define your configuration files [(ne)dots] or directories in `.nedots.yml`, or
in `.json` format if you'd prefer, and run `nedots sync` to pull in each of the
entries & push them to a remote repository.

Or if you've got some configuration that deserves its' own git repository,
maybe a complex `nvim` or `zsh` configuration, then define the `git_repo` in
config, and the repo will be added as a submodule.

# Why?

Dotfile repositories are generally used to share (or show off) your configuration,
and so that you have a back-up of your settings for when you inevitably distro
hop. This tool makes the process that much easier, and is very easy to configure.
Just list the files or directories that you're interested in storing remotely,
run a single command, and that's that.
